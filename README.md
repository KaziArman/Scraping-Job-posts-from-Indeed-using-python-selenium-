Indeed often changes their website's DOM, therefore it is hard to keep the code up to date. Although I changed the outdated code with this new one, it can change anytime. The basic of this code is simple, you will just have to change the CSS Selector or Xpath whenever Indeed changes their DOM.


Hope this work of mine will help you greatly.
